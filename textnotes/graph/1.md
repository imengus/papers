# .
- bipartite: V can be partitioned into U + W, with each edge of G having one endpoint in U and W
- regular graph: all vertices have equal degree --> platonic solids
- Bouquets: single vertex with n self loops
- dipole: 2 vertices + n edges
- path graph: edges lie on a same line, |V| = |E| + 1
- circulant graphs
- line graph has edges as vertices, and new edges are formed if the edges of G have a vertex in common
