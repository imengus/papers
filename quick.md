- underused due to computational complexity
- cycles containing a odd number of negative edges = unstable, not just triad
- there are different measures of balance: cycles, triangles, eigenvalues
- frustration index = line index of balance = minimum number of edges that keep the network away from total balance
- pearsons vs other measures of time series?
- monotone subsystems?
- Ising model without special structure?
- Davis's weak balance vs frustration index?
- correlation clustering problem?
- 36000 edges using shen's regions
- balances = bipolarity = if each negative edge joins vertices belonging to different subsets
- breadth first search
- if eigenvalues of signed and unsigned adjacency matrices are equal, signed network is balanced?
- switching function: sign of cycle remains the same if all nodes in one
- use weighting function in degree of balance depending on which length of cycle you want to give priority to
- unbalanced triads account mostly for tension and disonance
- for acyclic graphs, divide by 1
- graph density is 2m / n(n-1)
- why are they coloured white or black?
