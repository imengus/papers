- [x] ABIDE and Southwest brain scans combined
- [ ] scan parameters (MRI wiki):
	- [ ] voxel sizes
	- [ ] structural/ functional flip angle
	- [x] structural/ functional echo time
	- [x] s/f repetition time
- [x] all healthy subjects selected with FRT = 2 / time between each radiofrequency pulse
- [x] classify into five life span stages (Erikson's stages)
- [ ] FSL - FSL wiki/ tutorial videos
- [ ] AFNI - AFNI intro, Cox 1996
- [ ] preprocessing - FSL lectures + walkthrough / other's implementation's online
	- [x] extract brain tissue from T1 image - other's implementations in FSL tutorial
	- [x] segment into GM, WM, CSF
	- [x] magnetic stability correction: remove first five volumes
	- [ ] registering volumes: using least square optimisation with three translational and three rotational variables
	- [x] Gaussian kernel FWHM = 5mm smoothing of volumes
	- [ ] voxel time series: exclude non relevant information: band pass filtering (0.01-0.09 Hz)
	- [ ] voxel time series: 3 translational + 3 rotational confound regression of motion/ WM/ CSF signals
	- [ ] volume normalisation to MNI152 standard space: optimisation of 12 variables: 3 translational, 3 rotational, 3 scaling, 3 shearing variables
	- [ ] NOT regressing out the global signal
	- [ ] low extraction and registration quality inspection
	- [ ] how acquired: movement parameters greater than one voxel size
- [ ] extract 268 regional activity patterns of first 147 volumes based on Shen's atlas
