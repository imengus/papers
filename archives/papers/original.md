## Knowledge gained
- frustration = conflictual signed link arrangements that increase complexity?
- network frustration = closed cycle of signed links having an odd number of negative links and frustrating properties
- frustration --> disorder --> flexibility for brain network organisation
- considering the components independently risks oversimplification
- signs of links frequently disregarded
- negative link = antisynchronous coactivation
- we share common enemies --> balanced; friend's friend = enemy --> imbalanced --> pressure for relationships to alter (me, Chris, Ruby)? / system energy cannot is not minimal
- negative hubs can form to increase network balance / stability
- visual, limbic, default mode are some of the canonical networks (according to Shen's atlas)
- uniform engagement of regions in frustration formation --> expected values
- subcortical structures + brainstem major causes of frustration as one ages
- visual and somatomotor networks in later stages have relatively high organisation
- $\binom{2}{N_{ROI}}$ = number of links in a fully connected network with N_ROI ragions
## Abstract/ Intro
