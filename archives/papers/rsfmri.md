# Significant
- amplitude of low frequency fluctuations
- regional homogeneity using Kendall coefficient in low frequency range, with nearest neighbors
- 0.01 - 0.027 cortical neuronal activity
- 0.073 basal ganglia
- functional correlation tensors
- smoothed voxels --> get significantly connected voxels together and their edges
- cortical surface ReHo: 53 Zuo et al
- signal power
- functional connectivitiy density analysis
- ICA and graph analysis
- seed based metrics
	- cross correlation coefficient
	- partial correlations
	- multiple regressions
	- synchronisation likelihood
- multivariate decomposition
- DMN emerges from ICA analysis
- single networks may be broken into sub networks
- independent vector analysis
- Automated Anatomical Labeling gives 116 nodes
- use FCD, fractional ALFF, ReHo, and graph theory to identify ROI
