1. YOU ARE DOING THIS CUZ YOU CAN. Initially it's going to seem like you are feeling around in the dark, but that feeling never goes away. Thus is the exhilaration of research
2. create a list of methods used and what you need to learn (and how next to it) to *understand* the overview
4. do analysis described on one subject and compare to data on that subject
3. dissect their code on R on paper to find why they've done each step
5. implement the code in python (first, then if you manage perfectly c++ but only if its quicker than native implementations with numba)
6. read other papers on google scholar to diversify ideas
7. trial for other open source datasets and see how the data compares
8. use same method to see how patterns of frustration change in psilocybin administration

- Be passionate, not because you are achieving something difficult, but because each moment is an expression of novelty. You are only a novice once!
- Only achievement is the end goal, and feeling love at every step of the way.
- Don't expect to understand everything first time around. Just convince yourself that it is easy to eventually understand
- At every step understand the format of the data, the output, and the gist in layman's terms. That's all you need to do

Next steps:
- undergo preprocessing tutorials
- understand neuroimaging data by loading it and playing around with it in python --> see if you can create a slicing tool
